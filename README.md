# TKO Lab

## Fraud Detection

This is the CML port of the prototype which is part of the [Deep Learning for Anomaly Detection](https://ff12.fastforwardlabs.com/) report from Cloudera Fast Forward Labs.

## Auto Deploy

To build all the project artifacts, run the `0_cdsw-build.py` file in a Python3 session.

## Model Training

A trained model comes with the project, and can be directly used if you only need to present a demo. If you wish to retrain the model, use `1_fraud-model-train.ipynb`.

## Model View

If you wish to get a quick view of the trained model, use `3_fraud-model-view.ipynb`.
